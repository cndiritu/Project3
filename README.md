# Project3
Project Topics: interface design, implementation, javadoc style documentation, proper javadoc style

In this project I worked with a partner, another  MLT fellow, to creating a virtual pet. This project is a culmination of various skills taught throughought the first half of my Spring 2022 semester of Software Design. My partner and I were tasked with creating a Cat class and CatOwner class, that implemented from the Pet class and Owner class providing to us. We were also tasked with creating a user interface that allowed users to interact with a Cat as a CatOwner. Another key part of this project was creating a random event that would affect the Cat class. For this project I worked primarily on the Cat class and User Interface class.
